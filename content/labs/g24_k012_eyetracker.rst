********
The lab is used primarily for behavioral and eye tracking experiments.

.. class:: todo

  **TODO:** mention back projected screen

Software
********
There are two Presentation Computers. One is a legacy, Windows XP machine (with
"some version" of Matlab installed). The other runs a semi-standard Debian
Jessie (8) setup with Matlab 2012b, PsychoPy, and Psychtoolbox installed. It has
been configured to match the timing/configuration requirements of both PsychoPy
and Psychtoolbox.

There is no KVM-Matrix, so switching between the two requires that all wires be
disconnected and reconnected to the desired computer.
