Overview
********
The lab has two soundproof cabins with Faraday cages for EEG experiments.
Each cabin has its own KVM matrix, which allows for nearly complete flexibility
over which computer (EEG recorder, Eye Tracker, Presentation Machine, or
researcher supplied Laptop) displays to any screen — and routes both audio and
USB.

The KVM matrices are also interconnected, so one machine can display to both
cabins.

  EEG; speakers; eye tracking

Cabin 2 (right)
  EEG; pain stimulation; Current Designs peripherals

Software
********
The Presentation Computers run Windows 7 and have been configured in
compliance with Brain Products' official guidelines. These machines should
never, under any circumstances, be connected to the network.

Both machines run Matlab (2012b) and Presentation (multiple versions).

Current Designs
***************
A `Current Designs 932`_ unit is connected to the Presentation Computer of the
right cabin. The following MR safe peripherals are available:

* `Tethyx Joystick`_
* `Bimanual Grip Force`_

Pain Stimulation
****************
Two Digitimer current stimulators are available, the `DS5`_ and `DS7A`_. In
practice, however, only the DS7A is used, as the DS5 is unable to provide enough
current to be aversive enough for subjects.

The DS7A pulse can be triggered by software, but the intensity cannot be
controlled by software. Thus, the initial calibration must be done manually.

Speakers
********
`Avantone Passive MixCubes`_ were selected because they have a well understood
sonic profile (modeled after the well known Auratones) and an overall linear
frequency response. They are also shielded, to prevent interference.

KVM Matrix
**********
The Gefen EXT-DVIKVM-444DL KVM Matrix (`datasheet`_; `manual`_) is the key piece
that makes it possible to use all the computers, screens, USB peripherals, and
audio devices — in all the needed combinations. It is also a DVI amplifier,
enabling reliable signal for the longer cable runs into the EEG cabins.

Each matrix can connect to 4 computers (1x DVI; 1x USB; 1x 3.5mm audio) and
4 control stations (1x screen; 1x keyboard; 1x speakers/headphones).

Any control station can connect to any computer — and even *multiple* control
stations can be connected to the same computer.

To demonstrate how this is useful, the following is a common experiment
workflow:

EEG Recorder is displayed inside the cabin:
  as the technician flows the gel into the caps, they need to see which ones
  have good contact
Eye Tracker is displayed inside the cabin:
  to run the calibration
Presentation Machine (or Researcher's Laptop) is displayed inside the cabin:
  to display the actual experiment

Each control station has a Perixx keyboard (Periboard 409) that has 2 additional
USB ports. One is used for a mouse; the other can be used by other USB response
devices (joystick, etc). These are all routed, via the Gefen matrix, to the
appropriate computer.

Monitors
********
The colored dots on the monitors match the Gefen matrix remote.

Recording Monitor (Green/Input #1)
  Samsung SyncMaster SA450
  The vertical orientation allows viewing many EEG channels simultaneously.

Eye Tracking Monitor (Brown/Input #2)
  Requires a 4:3 ratio monitor

Presentation Monitor (Blue/Input #3)
  Samsung SyncMaster 2233RZ

In-Cabin Monitor (Red/Input #4)
  Samsung SyncMaster 2233RZ

The `Samsung 2233RZ`_ was specifically chosen because of a paper that measured
its timing and found it to be favorable.
